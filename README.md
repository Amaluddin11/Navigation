# Bananas Collector - Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Project 1

# Project Details

project environment (state and action spaces, when it is solve)

In this project, an agent is trained to navigate and collect bananas in an environment from [Unity](https://unity.com

This project involves training an agent to navigate a virtual world and collect yellow bananas while avoiding blue bananas. The agent interacts with the world using a Unity-based environment provided by [Unity Technologies](https://unity.com). The environment is called Banana Collector and contains 37 state features that the agent can observe, such as the agent's velocity and the ray-based perception of objects in the agent's forward direction. The agent takes actions based on the observed state and receives a reward of +1 for collecting a yellow banana and -1 for collecting a blue banana. The goal of the agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.
